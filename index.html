<h1>New evidence raises doubts about the longest US war crimes investigation of the Iraq war and how US forces are held to account.</h1>
<!-- <h2>raises doubts about the <u>longest</u> US war crimes</h2> -->
<p>When I rather nervously shared a <mark>personal post</mark>  about dealing with brain fog at work on the social network LinkedIn last week, I had no idea that it would have such an enormous impact.

It's been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Women have stopped me on the street to talk to me about it.

I've been overwhelmed by hundreds of messages from people sharing support and their own experiences of it.

Usually I cover technology news. But given the response, it felt important to talk about this as well.

"Brain fog" isn't a medical term. But you may well know exactly what I'm talking about.

That moment when you suddenly can't remember the word for something really obvious, or you're mid-sentence and you lose your train of thought. It's infuriating, and it can be embarrassing.</p>
